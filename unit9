### Introduction
In APCSA (AP Computer Science A) we are curretly learning about inheritence (unit 9). This unit has been confusing and challenging for me since a lot of new concepts were introduced to me. I didn't do to well on the quiz and exam so throughout this write up I will take you through my challenges I had and some of the questions I got wrong on the tests. 

### Challenge #1
One challenge I had when learning inheritaence is learning what and how to use `super()`. I was confused on when to use it and hot it works. To understand this I watched youtube videos about this. For example I watched [this]() video that helped me understand what `super()` is. Throughout this video I learned that `super()` can access constructors and methods in the parent class but not all like private methods.
``` java
public String toString(){
    return super.toString() + " with " + flavor;
  }
```

### Challenge #2

### Challenge #3
In this challenge I will take you through some of the questions I got wrong on the unit test

#### Challenge #3.1 - 3.2
public class A
{
  public A()
  {
    System.out.print("one orange ");
  }
  
  public A(int z)
  {
    System.out.print("two oranges ");
  }

  public void doStuff()
  {
    System.out.print("six oranges ");
  }
}

public class B extends A
{
  public B()
  {
    super();
    System.out.print("three oranges ");
  }

  public B(int val)
  {
    super(val);
    System.out.print("four oranges ");
  }
} 
What is `A a = new B(5);`?
For this question I chose `four oranges` but it was wrong because I thought it would go directly to `public B(int val)` and print `four oranges` but I was wrong.
