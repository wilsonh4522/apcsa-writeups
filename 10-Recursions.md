### Challenge #1
One challenge I had when learning unit 10 is figuring out how recursions work and the sequence it has. To figure this out I went to phython tutor where it shows each step it goes through to better understand how it works 
``` java
public static void printNumber(int n)
{
  if (n >= 10)
  {
    printNumber(n / 10);
  }
  System.out.println(n % 10);
}
```
When n = 1497, it is greater than 10 so we divide it by 10. 149 is greater than 10 so we divide by 10 again to then get 14. This is also greater than
